Either get the downgrade discs from Lenovo or follow the guide here to do it yourself. Please remember to make the Vista recovery set before doing this. (The instructions are two posts up.)
Get out the recovery set you made before downgrading and run them. If you don't have them you will have to contact Lenovo for a replacement set. Have your credit card ready.
